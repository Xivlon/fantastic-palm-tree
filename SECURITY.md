# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the Fantastic Palm Tree framework, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report
**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please:
1. Email the maintainers directly (create a private issue)
2. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability
3. Provide steps to reproduce the issue
4. Include potential impact assessment

### What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected versions
- Potential impact and exploitation scenarios
- Suggested mitigation (if any)

### Response Process
1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
3. **Fix Development**: We will work on a fix with appropriate priority
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure with the reporter
5. **Credit**: We will credit the reporter (unless they prefer anonymity)

## Security Considerations for Users

### Trading-Related Security
- **Never commit API keys or credentials** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
- **Validate all market data** before trading decisions
- **Implement position size limits** to control risk
- **Monitor for unusual trading behavior** in live systems

### Data Security
- **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit
- **Use secure communication** with broker APIs
- **Validate all input data** to prevent injection attacks
- **Log security-related events** for audit trails

### Infrastructure Security
- **Keep dependencies updated** to latest secure versions
- **Use secure deployment practices** in production
- **Implement proper access controls** for trading systems
- **Regular security audits** of production deployments

### CI/CD Pipeline Security
- **GitHub Actions are pinned to specific versions** to prevent supply chain attacks
- **Critical actions can be pinned to commit SHAs** for enhanced security
- **Automated security scanning** with pip-audit, bandit, and semgrep
- **Dependency vulnerability monitoring** via GitHub security advisories
- **Secret scanning** to prevent credential leaks

## Supported Versions
We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | Security Updates Until |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: | Until 0.2.0 release   |
| < 0.1   | :x:                | Not supported          |

### Version Support Policy
- **Current Major Version**: Full security and bug fix support
- **Previous Major Version**: Security updates only for 6 months after new major release
- **End of Life**: Versions older than the previous major version receive no updates

## Dependency Management and Security

### Dependency Upgrade Cadence

#### Automated Updates
- **Security patches**: Applied immediately upon availability
- **Minor version updates**: Weekly automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- **Major version updates**: Reviewed manually before integration

#### Update Schedule
- **Daily**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Weekly**: Automated dependency updates for patch/minor versions
- **Monthly**: Review and testing of major dependency updates
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive dependency audit and cleanup

#### Critical Security Updates
For dependencies with critical security vulnerabilities:
1. **Within 24 hours**: Assessment and emergency patch if exploitable
2. **Within 48 hours**: Testing and validation in staging environment
3. **Within 72 hours**: Production deployment with release notes

### Dependency Security Monitoring
We use multiple tools to monitor dependency security:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Automatic vulnerability alerts
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates and security patches
- **pip-audit**: Regular scanning for known vulnerabilities
- **SAFETY**: Additional vulnerability database checking

### Pinning Strategy
- **Production dependencies**: Pinned to specific versions in `requirements-lock.txt`
- **Development dependencies**: Allow minor version updates for latest features
- **Security-critical packages**: Conservative update approach with thorough testing

#### Dependency Categories
1. **Core Framework Dependencies**: Conservative updates with extensive testing
2. **Development Tools**: Regular updates for improved developer experience
3. **Optional Features**: Isolated updates that don't affect core functionality
4. **Transitive Dependencies**: Monitored but updated through primary dependencies

## Security Best Practices
1. Always use the latest version of the framework
2. Keep all dependencies updated
3. Never store credentials in code
4. Use secure communication protocols
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Regular security reviews of trading logic
