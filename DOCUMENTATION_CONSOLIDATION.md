All documentation has been successfully consolidated into a single, comprehensive `README.md` file. This provides users with a single source of truth for understanding and using the Fantastic Palm Tree framework.

## Changes Made

### Before Consolidation
- `README.md` (70 lines) - Basic overview
- `Architecture.md` (580 lines) - Architecture documentation  
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (105 lines) - Feature summary
- `INTERFACE_SUMMARY.md` (173 lines) - Interface documentation
- `MIGRATION.md` (138 lines) - Migration guide
- `docs/INTERFACES.md` (295 lines) - Detailed interface docs
- `docs/METRICS_PIPELINE.md` (233 lines) - Metrics pipeline docs
- `docs/TEST_COVERAGE.md` (69 lines) - Test coverage overview
- `docs/ATR_BREAKOUT_STRATEGY.md` (354 lines) - Strategy reference

**Total: 9 files, 2,017 lines**

### After Consolidation
- `README.md` (1,283 lines) - Comprehensive documentation
- `README_original.md` (70 lines) - Backup of original README
- `README_comprehensive.md` (1,283 lines) - Working copy during development

**Total: 1 primary file, 1,283 lines**

18. **Performance & Best Practices** - Optimization and best practices
19. **API Reference** - Core class documentation

## Optional Cleanup

The individual documentation files are still present and can be:

### Option 1: Keep for Reference
Leave the original files in place for developers who want to reference specific sections.

### Option 2: Archive
Move to a `docs/archive/` directory:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/archive
mv Architecture.md IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md INTERFACE_SUMMARY.md MIGRATION.md docs/archive/
```

### Option 3: Remove
Delete the individual files since all content is now in the main README:
```bash
rm Architecture.md IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md INTERFACE_SUMMARY.md MIGRATION.md
rm docs/INTERFACES.md docs/METRICS_PIPELINE.md docs/ATR_BREAKOUT_STRATEGY.md
```

## Benefits for Users
