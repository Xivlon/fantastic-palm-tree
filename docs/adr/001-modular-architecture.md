# ADR-001: Modular Architecture Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The backtesting framework needed an architectural approach that would support:
- Multiple trading strategies
- Different risk management approaches  
- Various technical indicators
- Extensibility for new features
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testability and maintainability

## Decision
We adopted a modular architecture with the following principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a clearly defined purpose
2. **Loose Coupling**: Modules interact through well-defined interfaces
3. **High Cohesion**: Related functionality is grouped together
4. **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected rather than hard-coded

### Module Structure
```

├── strategy/       # Trading strategy implementations
├── risk/          # Risk management modules
├── indicators/    # Technical indicators
├── models/        # Data models and types
├── config.py      # Configuration management
├── results.py     # Result handling
└── exceptions.py  # Exception definitions
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Easy to add new strategies and indicators
- Clear testing boundaries
- Reduced coupling between components
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Enables plugin-style architecture

### Negative
- Slightly more complex initial setup
- More files to manage
- Need to maintain interface contracts

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive documentation of interfaces
- Type hints to enforce contracts
- Integration tests to validate module interactions
