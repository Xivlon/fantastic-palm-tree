# ADR-002: Type Safety Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Python's dynamic typing can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to debug, especially in financial applications where accuracy is critical. We needed to establish a type safety strategy that would:
- Catch errors early in development
- Improve code clarity and documentation
- Enable better IDE support
- Reduce runtime failures

## Decision
We adopted comprehensive type safety using:

1. **Type Hints**: Full type annotation throughout the codebase
2. **Dataclasses**: Strongly typed data structures for configuration and results
3. **Protocol Classes**: Interface definitions for extensibility
4. **Runtime Validation**: Configuration validation at startup

### Implementation
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Protocol, Any
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

@dataclass
class StrategyConfig:
    atr_period: int = 14
    exits: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
    
    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        self._validate()

class StrategyProtocol(Protocol):
    def process_bar(self, bar: MarketBar) -> StrategyResult:
        ...
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Earlier error detection during development
- Better IDE support with autocomplete and error detection
- Self-documenting code through type annotations
- Reduced runtime errors
- Easier refactoring and maintenance

### Negative
- Additional development overhead for type annotations
- Learning curve for Python developers not familiar with typing
- Some complexity in generic types

### Mitigation
- Gradual adoption starting with critical paths
- Type checking tools integration in CI/CD
- Team training on Python typing best practices
