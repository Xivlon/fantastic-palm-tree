# Issue Migration Guide

## Overview
This document provides guidance for converting the comprehensive task lists from PRs #41-43 into discrete, manageable GitHub issues.

## Task Categories and Issue Templates

The repository improvement tasks have been organized into five main categories, each with dedicated issue templates:

### 1. Documentation (`documentation.md`)
**Scope**: All documentation-related improvements
- API documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Developer documentation
- Code comments and inline documentation
- README updates
- Architecture documentation
- Migration guides
- Examples and sample code

### 2. Governance (`governance.md`)
**Scope**: Project governance and policy improvements
- Project policies (LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY.md)
- Contributing guidelines
- Code review processes
- Release management
- Project roadmap and planning
- Decision-making processes
- Community guidelines

### 3. CI/CD (`cicd.md`)
**Scope**: Continuous integration and deployment improvements
- Build pipeline enhancements
- Test automation
- Code quality checks and linting
- Deployment processes
- Performance testing
- Security scanning in CI
- Dependency management automation
- Release automation

### 4. Security (`security.md`)
**Scope**: Security-related improvements and hardening
- Vulnerability assessments
- Dependency security scanning
- Authentication and authorization
- Data protection measures
- Secrets management
- Security documentation
- Incident response procedures
- Security best practices

### 5. Architecture (`architecture.md`)
**Scope**: System architecture and technical design improvements
- System design and structure
- Code organization and modularity
- Performance optimizations
- Scalability improvements
- Technical debt reduction
- Design pattern implementation
- Integration point improvements
- API design

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: High Priority Issues
Extract and create issues for:
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes or compatibility issues
- Build/CI failures
- Major documentation gaps

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Issues
Create issues for:
- CI/CD pipeline improvements
- Development environment setup
- Automation tooling
- Release processes

### Phase 3: Enhancement Issues
Create issues for:
- Feature enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Code quality improvements
- User experience enhancements

### Phase 4: Maintenance Issues
Create issues for:
- Technical debt reduction
- Code refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Dependency updates

## Issue Creation Workflow

1. **Review the PR task lists** in PRs #41-43
2. **Identify the category** for each task
3. **Use the appropriate issue template**
4. **Fill out all relevant sections** in the template
5. **Add appropriate labels** based on category and priority
6. **Link related issues** if applicable
7. **Assign to appropriate team members** if known

## Task Breakdown by PR

### PR #41 - Original Problem Statement
Focus on foundational repository hygiene and structure

### PR #42 - Governance & Documentation (Issues 1-15)
- Project governance files
- Documentation consolidation
- Architecture decision records
- Risk disclaimers

### PR #43 - Technical Infrastructure (Issues 26-34)
- CI/CD pipeline enhancements
- Testing infrastructure
- Code quality automation
- Development tooling

## Labels and Organization

### Standard Labels
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `governance` - Project governance and policies
- `ci/cd` - Continuous integration/deployment
- `security` - Security-related issues
- `architecture` - System architecture changes

### Priority Labels
- `priority/critical` - Must be addressed immediately
- `priority/high` - Should be addressed soon
- `priority/medium` - Normal priority
- `priority/low` - Nice to have

### Size Labels
- `size/xs` - Very small change (< 1 day)
- `size/s` - Small change (1-2 days)
- `size/m` - Medium change (3-5 days)
- `size/l` - Large change (1-2 weeks)
- `size/xl` - Very large change (> 2 weeks)

## Quality Assurance

When creating issues, ensure:
- **Clear title** that summarizes the task
- **Detailed description** of the current state and desired outcome
- **Acceptance criteria** that define when the issue is complete
- **Appropriate labels** for categorization and prioritization
- **Realistic scope** - break down large tasks into smaller, manageable issues
