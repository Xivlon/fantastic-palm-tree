# Experimental Features Governance

## Overview
This document outlines the governance process for experimental features in the Fantastic Palm Tree framework.

## Definition of Experimental Features
Experimental features are:
- New functionality under active development
- Features that may change significantly before stabilization
- Implementations that are not yet battle-tested in production
- APIs that may be modified or removed in future versions

## Experimental Feature Lifecycle

### 1. Proposal Phase
- Feature proposed through GitHub issue or RFC
- Community discussion and feedback
- Technical design review
- Approval from maintainers

### 2. Experimental Implementation
- Feature implemented with `experimental_` prefix
- Clear documentation marking experimental status
- Warning messages when experimental features are used
- Separate testing and validation

### 3. Stabilization Process
- Community testing and feedback collection
- Performance and reliability validation
- API refinement based on usage patterns
- Security and compliance review

### 4. Graduation or Removal
- **Graduation**: Feature becomes stable, warnings removed
- **Modification**: API changes based on feedback
- **Removal**: Feature discontinued if not viable

## Usage Guidelines

### For Framework Developers
```python
# Experimental features should be clearly marked
def experimental_new_strategy(config: dict) -> Strategy:
    warnings.warn(
        "experimental_new_strategy is experimental and may change in future versions",
        FutureWarning,
        stacklevel=2
    )
    # Implementation
```

### For Framework Users
- Experimental features are **not recommended for production trading**
- APIs may change without deprecation warnings
- Features may be removed in any release
- Use at your own risk for research and development

## Documentation Requirements
Experimental features must include:
- Clear experimental status in documentation
- Expected timeline for stabilization
- Known limitations and issues
- Migration path for API changes

## Deprecation Policy
- Experimental features may be removed without standard deprecation
- Stable features follow semantic versioning for deprecation
- 6-month notice for removing stable features
- Migration guides provided for breaking changes
