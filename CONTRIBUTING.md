## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fantastic-palm-tree.git
   cd fantastic-palm-tree
   ```
3. Set up the development environment (see [Development Setup](#development-setup))

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher (for frontend components)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
pre-commit install

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run Python tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=fantastic_palm_tree --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest -k "test_strategy"
pytest -m slow  # For slow/integration tests

# Run frontend tests
npm test
```

### Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
ruff format .

# Lint code
ruff check .

# Type checking
mypy fantastic_palm_tree/

# Run all quality checks
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy fantastic_palm_tree/
```

## Making Changes

### Creating a Branch

Create a descriptive branch name:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-risk-management
git checkout -b fix/trailing-stop-calculation
git checkout -b docs/update-installation-guide
```

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Examples:
```
Add trailing stop loss functionality

Implement ATR-based trailing stops with configurable activation
and distance parameters. Closes #123.

- Add TrailingStopManager class
- Integrate with existing position management
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Update documentation
```

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Tests should be fast and reliable

### Test Categories

- **Unit tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-end tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Performance tests**: Test performance-critical paths

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from fantastic_palm_tree.strategy import EnhancedStrategy

def test_trailing_stop_activation():
    """Test that trailing stops activate at the correct R-multiple."""
    strategy = EnhancedStrategy(config={
        'trailing': {
            'activation_r_multiple': 2.0
        }
    })
    # Test implementation...
```

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Run code quality checks
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Add entry to CHANGELOG.md for significant changes
5. Rebase your branch on the latest main

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the main repository
2. **Fill Template**: Use the provided PR template
3. **Link Issues**: Reference related issues using keywords (fixes #123)
4. **Request Review**: Tag appropriate reviewers
5. **Address Feedback**: Respond to review comments promptly
6. **Update Branch**: Keep your branch up-to-date with main

### Pull Request Checklist

## Code Style

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings for all public functions and classes

```python
def calculate_position_size(
    account_balance: float,
    risk_percentage: float,
    stop_distance: float,
    price: float
) -> int:
    """Calculate position size based on risk management rules.
    
    Args:
        account_balance: Current account balance
        risk_percentage: Risk as percentage of account (0.0-1.0)
        stop_distance: Distance to stop loss in price units
        price: Current asset price
        
    Returns:
        Position size in shares
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If inputs are invalid
    """
    # Implementation...
```
